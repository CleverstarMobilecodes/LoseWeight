<h3> For Your Safety</h3>

<h3>Application Settings</h3>

<h4>Audio Instructions</h4>
    
<p>You can disable the audio instructions that precede the hypnotic session in the Settings tab.

<h4>Hypnotic Booster</h4>
    
<p>A powerful feature in this app is the Hypnotic Booster, which is a special combination of sound frequencies (a slightly different one for each ear) that will make you more receptive to suggestion. You can enable the Hypnotic Booster under the Settings tab, and you can adjust its volume on the main Listen screen. You must use headphones or earbuds to experience the benefit of the hypnotic booster. When it&#8217;s enabled, you&#8217;ll hear a gentle hum. Set the volume so the hum is just barely audible. A higher volume does not increase its effect, and you may find the higher volume distracting. It&#8217;s perfectly fine to listen to the Hypnotic Booster along with the background music or nature sounds. <br>

<h4>Awaken at End</h4>

<p>You can listen to this recording at any time of day, including bedtime. If you want to drift off to sleep after the end of the session, disable the Awaken at End feature under the Settings tab.

<h4>Choosing Background Music</h4>
    
<p>In addition to the sound of my voice, this application also includes background sounds that are carefully designed to deepen your state of relaxation. In the Settings tab, you can choose from a variety of relaxing music or nature sounds, or disable the background sounds altogether.

<h4>Delay Ending</h4>
    
<p>The Delay Ending feature will continue the background sounds for the specified period of time after the voice session ends. This can be helpful if you&#8217;d like a more gradual transition out of the hypnotic state.

<h4>Play Count</h4>
    
<p>To repeat the voice session automatically, set Play Count to 2, 3, or Loop. Loop will cause the voice session to loop indefinitely, so it&#8217;s recommended that you use this setting when the device is plugged in to a power source.

<h4>Do Not Disturb</h4>
    
<p>To avoid electronic interruptions, enable your device&#8217;s Do Not Disturb feature.
